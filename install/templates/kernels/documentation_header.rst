 %(dimension)d-dimensional Connectivity Patterns
===================================================

Available connectivity patterns for %(dimension)dd lattices.

LatticeFlow works with fixed connectivity patterns, here refered to as
*kernels*.  The following fixed patterns are available in this
installation.
